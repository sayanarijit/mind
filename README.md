Productive mind
===============

A productive can mind push and pop tasks into it's stack efficiently
----------------------------------------------------------------

Push a task into the mind stack (or continue with an existing task)

```bash
mind

# Enter a name for the task to push
```

Pop the current task from the mind stack

```bash
mind pop
```

I'll keep adding features (small or big) and keep improving the code quality while I learn more cool ways to be productive.

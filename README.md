Productive mind
===============

A productive mind can push and pop tasks into it's stack efficiently
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Push tasks into the mind stack (or continue with an existing task)

```bash
mind

# Enter the names for the tasks to push.
# Press [ENTER] again to save the added tasks.
```

Pop the current task from the mind stack

```bash
mind pop
```

I'll keep adding features (small or big) and keep improving the code quality
while I learn more cool ways to be productive and become better developer.
